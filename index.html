        <p align="justify">I am an Associate Professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department at Arizona State University. My research interests lie in the intersection of <b>AI</b> and <b>Robotics</b>, focusing on innovating and applying AI and Machine Learning methods to <b>human-robot teaming, multi-agent systems, distributed robotic systems, human-robot interaction,  planning and automated reasoning</b>.
        The goal of my research is to bring heterogeneous agents, such as humans and robots, seamlessly together to improve our everyday lives, and achieve complex tasks that have never been achieved before.</p>

        <p align="justify"><b>About me</b>: Prior to my current position, I was a research assistant professor at Arizona State University from 2015-2016. Before that, I worked at the <a href = "http://rakaposhi.eas.asu.edu/yochan.html/">Yochan AI Research Group</a> as a postdoctoral researcher from 2013-2015. I received my PhD degree at the <a href = "http://dilab.eecs.utk.edu/DILresearch.html">Distributed Intelligence Lab</a> in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from the University of Tennessee in August 2012, under the advising of <a href = "http://web.eecs.utk.edu/~leparker/">Prof. Lynne E Parker</a>. My PhD research was on significantly extending the state-of-the-art distributed robot systems by enabling heterogeneous robots to form and execute complex coalitions in dynamic environments.</p>
