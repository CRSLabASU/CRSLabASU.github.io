        The current research focus of Cooperative Robotic Systems (CRS) Lab is on the theories and practices of areas within the broad fields of <b>artificial intelligence</b> and <b>robotics</b>, as well as emerging interdisciplinary research areas that integrate these two fields (e.g., humans in the loop of automated systems and cyber-physical systems). The goal of our research is to bring humans and automated systems seamlessly together to improve our everyday lives (e.g., in smart homes and for elderly care), and to achieve complex tasks that has never been achieved before (e.g., human-robot teaming in urban search and rescue and decision support systems). To accomplish this, new technologies must be developed to extend traditional <b>Perception and Modeling</b>, <b>Decision Making</b>, <b>Learning and Adapatation</b> and <b>Communication</b> capabilities of intelligent agents to allow them to work with <b>humans in the loop</b> (Check out CRS publications <a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~yzhan442/publications.html">HERE</a>):
